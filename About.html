        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>Hello! I’m Mervyn George, a second-year Creative Computing student at Bath Spa University RAK Academic Center. I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology to build engaging, user-centered digital experiences.</p>

        <p>Alongside my studies, I’ve developed an interest in enterprise innovation, digital transformation, and people-centric leadership. I’m fascinated by how emerging technologies like cloud computing, AI, and data-driven design can solve real-world challenges and improve business outcomes.</p>

        <p>My professional interests are supported by project experience and research in both front-end development and strategic tech thinking. I aspire to work in roles that allow me to simplify complex problems, collaborate across disciplines, and design practical solutions that scale.</p>

        <p>Outside the classroom, I enjoy speaking with mentors in the industry, following ethical innovation trends, and exploring how technology can be used to empower people and communities.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry through continuous learning, creativity, and a strong foundation in both design and strategy.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of academics, I’m a firm believer in lifelong learning. I enjoy exploring topics at the intersection of technology and society, especially how digital tools can improve education, sustainability, and accessibility.</p>
        <p>In my downtime, you’ll find me reading tech blogs, watching tutorials, mentoring peers, or sketching UI/UX ideas for potential web projects. I’m also passionate about travel, which gives me a fresh perspective on collaboration, design, and global digital culture.</p>
        <p>Above all, I value curiosity, empathy, and meaningful collaboration—whether through class projects, self-initiated ideas, or broader community work.</p>
